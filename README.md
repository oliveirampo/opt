# Force-field optimizatin

    * This project is part of an integrated scheme for the automated refinement of force-field parameters 
    against experimental condensed-phase data,
    considering entire classes of organic molecules
    constructed using a fragment library via combinatorial isomer enumeration.

    * The main steps of the scheme, referred to as CombiFF, are:

1. definition of a molecule family;

CombiFF workflow for the calibration of a force field based on a given compounds family.
