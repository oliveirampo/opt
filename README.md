# Force-field optimizatin

* This project is part of an integrated scheme for the automated refinement of force-field parameters 
against experimental condensed-phase data,
considering entire classes of organic molecules
constructed using a fragment library via combinatorial isomer enumeration.

* The main steps of the scheme, referred to as CombiFF, are:

  1. definition of a molecule family;
  2. combinatorial enumeration of all isomers;
  3. [query for experimental data](https://github.com/oliveirampo/combiff);
  4. automatic construction of the molecular topologies by fragment assembly;
  5. iterative refinement of the force-field parameters considering the entire family.

* This project is only concerned about topic (iv).

* There are two key aspects in this scheme:

  1. The force-field design relies on an [electronegativity-equalization scheme](https://github.com/oliveirampo/opt/blob/master/scr/EEM.py)
for the atomic partial charges [(J. Chem. Phys. 131, 044127 (2009))](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3187034).
  2. The optimization procedure used statistical-mechanical expressions.
